    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
		This guide provides assistance making websites and applications friendly for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. The patterns in this guide provide practical guidance to improve the accessibility of designs and the design process.
      </p>
	  <p>
		 The Objectives and Patterns presented here provide <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/#supplement">supplemental guidance</a> beyond the requirements of The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG [WCAG22]. They are intended to address barriers that could not be included in the normative WCAG [[WCAG22]] specification and may not otherwise be addressed.
	  </p>

      <p>
      	This guide is divided into design Objectives. An outline of these Objectives can also be found in the Summary section. Simply understanding the Objectives and related user stories may help designers make content more accessible to some users with cognitive and learning disabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
	   Each Objective contains a number of practical Patterns (repeated designs for controls and other elements) that describe what to do to address user needs. Implementing these Patterns is <strong>essential</strong> for some people with cognitive and learning impairments to be able to use content independently.

      <h2>
        Objective 1: Help Users Understand What Things are and How to Use Them
      </h2>
      <p>
      	Users with cognitive and learning disabilities may have trouble with orientation and learning. This can mean people get disoriented in a site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning new things and remembering new information is especially difficult for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. They can also struggle or be unable to learn new design patterns. Make controls, icons and elements simple and conventional to help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make it clear to users what things are and how to use them. This includes clearly indicating the purpose of:
      </p>
      <ul>
      	<li>a site,</li>
      	<li>section of a site, </li>
      	<li>page, </li>
      	<li>section of a page, and</li>
      	<li>controls.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Use headers, labels and other signposts to help users know the purpose of the page, region, or control.
      </p>
      <p>Help users understand how to use controls and elements on each page. </p>
      <p>
      	Use familiar design patterns, terms and icons to help users who struggle to remember new designs. Ensure the look, location and interaction of controls and other elements are familiar and consistent across the site.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Show a clear relationship between controls and the content they effect to help users understand the effect of possible actions and reduce potential confusion.
      </p>

        <h3>Make the Purpose of Your Page Clear (Pattern)</h3>
          <section><h5 class="coga-5">User Need</h5>
          <blockquote><p>I need to know the context and purpose of the page.</p></blockquote>
          <p>Related User Story: <a href="#clear-purpose-user-story" aria-label="Clear Purpose User Story">Clear Purpose</a>.</p>

          <section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
          <p>
            Help the user know the purpose of the content. Use:
          </p>
          <ul>
          	<li>A clear title or heading that summarizes the purpose of a page, or</li>
          	<li>other clear signposts that have been tested by users with cognitive and learning disabilities.</li>
          </ul>
          </section><section><h5  class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            This helps many people, including those with impaired memory and attention as well as anyone who is easily distracted due to age-related forgetfulness and AD(H)D.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, someone with mild dementia is using online shopping. They get distracted and then when they look at the screen again they have forgotten what they were doing. A clear heading at the top of each page shows clearly <strong>what the page is about and what they are doing</strong>.
          </p>
		  <p>In another example, a user with AD(H)D is looking for information in a video. They can tell by the video title that this video has the information they need.</p>
          </section>
          <section><h5  class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <p>Headings clarify the purpose of this specific page.</p>
		  <p>When possible, provide information to help users understand how they got to the page. For example: clearly indicating breadcrumbs on main navigation, highlighting currently selected tab, etc.</p>

          <p><strong><span class="avoid"></span>Avoid:</strong> </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Pages without clear headings or signposts  that tell the user where they are. For example:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Page headings that do not tell the user where they are, such as a page heading that reads "Service not available". The user has to remember what the service relates to.</li>
                  <li>
                    Page headings that do not clarify the steps in a form.
                  </li>
              </ul>
              </li>

        <h3>
          Use a Familiar Hierarchy and Design (Pattern)
        </h3>
          <section><h5 class="coga-5">User Need</h5>
        <blockquote><p>I need to understand my options and the tasks I can perform and I can identify the controls I can interact with to complete actions. (I find it hard to learn new interface design patterns.)</p></blockquote>
        <p>Related User Story: <a href="#clear-operation-user-story" aria-label="Clear Operation User Story">Clear Operation</a>.</p>
        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
        <p>
          Use common designs that are familiar to most users. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
        	<li>design elements </li>
        	<li>affordances (visual hints about how to a control)</li>
        	<li>patterns, and</li>
        	<li>the layout and visual hierarchy (arrangement of elements to show the order of importance).</li>
        </ul>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            Many users cannot easily learn and remember new design metaphors. Without these skills, it can be much harder or impossible to locate desired items with which to interact, and to know what interactions may do. Users can feel lost or overwhelmed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users are more likely to find and recognize common design elements that are repeated often over a long period of use, across many sites.
          </p>
		  <p>
		  For example, a user with a mild cognitive impairment or dementia, goes to a site to buy a product. They cannot find where to pay for the item that they want. They may think the site does not allow shopping and the site just provides information.
		</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <p>Common design elements, affordances and patterns include:</p>
          <ul>
			 <li>
              Create a standard layout and visual hierarchy (arrangement of elements to show the order of importance). Place elements where the user is expecting them. For example, in an English site:
              <ul>
                <li>
                 search in the top right hand corner in a website
                </li>
                <li>
                  link to the home page is in the top left hand corner
                </li>
                <li>link to &quot;contact us&quot; is in the top navigation area</li>
                <li>link to the site map is in the footer area, and</li>
                <li>the submit button is at the bottom of a form.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Common design patterns (repeated designs for controls and other elements), such as:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  WAI-ARIA authoring best practices [[wai-aria-practices-1.2]],
                </li>
                <li>
                  patterns used in the most popular sites,
                </li>
                <li>
                  very common navigation design patterns and common icons,
                </li>
                <li>
                	platform specific (operating system) user interface design for navigation mechanisms and icons, and
                </li>
                <li>
                	adaptive user interface design that can be personalized (see above).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              User interface (design) from a prior version. Allow users to revert back to a prior version of the application with which they are familiar.
            </li>
			<li>
              Links that look like links and buttons look and act like buttons. For example:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  underline links with a standard style throughout a page
                </li>
                <li>links generally navigate to a new page, and</li>
                <li>buttons generally perform an action.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ol>
           <li>
            When designing web pages, select standard components that look and behave the way users expect. Use standard conventions for layout such as:
            <ul>
            	<li>
            		home link in the upper left corner,
            	</li>
            	<li>
            		navigation at the top, and
            	</li>
            	<li>
            		search in the upper right.
            	</li>
            </ul>
          	</li>
          	<li>
          		Create an obvious visual hierarchy in the page.
          	</li>
          	</ol>

        <p>Use a consistent visual design across groups of pages.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>Many users take a long time to learn new designs and recognize elements. Once learned, the elements should be used throughout the site. </p>
          <p>
            For example, an older user with age-related forgetfulness takes a long time to learn new designs. When they come to a site, the first page takes time to understand, but then they know what to do on the next page. If the next page is different from the first and also difficult to learn, they become tired and make more mistakes. As they move to a third difficult page the cognitive load becomes too much and they cannot complete the task.
          </p>


          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <p>This includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Consistent design themes, including heading styles, font choices, icons, colors, visual appearance of controls, buttons and links.
            </li>
            <li>
              Headings with the same structural level have the same font and visual style.
            </li>
            <li>
              Icons, controls and menu items that have same function and role have the same look and style
            </li>
            <li>
              State and focus for elements with similar function and roles have the same style across a site.
            </li>
            <li>
              Layout is consistent across blocks of content. This  includes the position of interactive elements and navigational controls.
            </li>
            <li>
              Structure of content and style of presenting information is consistent. This includes the organization of blocks of text, icons,  images and bullet points.
            </li>
          </ul>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">Getting Started</h5>
          <p>
            Plan the design for your information before adding content. Think about the colors, font choices and areas where text and images will appear.
          </p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
       <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
          <ol>
          	<li>Headings at the same level look similar, across the site.</li>
          	<li>
          		A consistent look across the site for controls. For example:
          		<ul>
          			<li>Two submit buttons in a website, both look and function the same way.</li>
          			<li>All selected radio buttons on the site look the same.</li>
          			<li>When an item is tabbed to, it has focus and can be activated. The keyboard focus indicator (outline that shows which element has focus) for all links look the same.</li>
          		</ul>
          	</li>
          	<li>
          		A consistent location for common features. For example:
          		<ul>
          			<li>The search box is always in the same place in the entire site. </li>
          		</ul>
          	</li>
          </ol>
                <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>

          <ol>
          	<li>Elements with similar functions looking different. For example:
          	<ul>
          		<li>There are six heading level 2s on a page. Four are styled using Times New Roman, and two using Helvetica.</li>
          	</ul>
          	</li>
          	<li>
          		Elements with similar functions presented in different locations. For example:
          		<ul>
          			<li>Three pages have a submit button. One is located at the top of the form. One is located at the bottom. One is located in a sidebar.</li>

        <h3>Make Each Step Clear (Pattern)</h3>
          <section><h5  class="coga-5">User Need</h5>
          <blockquote><p>I need to recognize where I am in the architecture of the website, application or multi-step process, even after I get distracted.</p></blockquote>

		  </section><section class="wtd"><h5  class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
        <p>
          Provide breadcrumbs, a "how I got here" button, or heading to help the user orientate themselves inside a site or task.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a multi-step process, this includes showing:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the steps completed, </li>
          <li>the current step and the steps pending, and</li>
          <li>any important choices.</li>
        </ul>
          </section><section><h5  class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            This pattern helps a user who loses focus, forget what they are doing or gets distracted reorient themselves to their current activity. Clearly indicating the current location and progress helps the user continue after they lose focus without reading a great deal of content or restarting.
          </p>
          <p>Providing information about the steps that need to complete a task helps users determine if they can successfully finish the task. This is especially important for users who often find processes difficult to complete.</p>
          <p>Examples include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Someone with early stage dementia is interrupted in their task or loses focus and then cannot remember what they were doing. By seeing the bread crumbs they can remind themselves where they are and continue their task.
            </li>
            <li>
              Someone with an attention disability gets distracted and then needs to pick up where they left off.
            </li>
            <li>
              Someone with a processing difficulty is not sure if this application has too many steps and if they will manage. By seeing they are half-way through they can gauge if they can cope with the entire process.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </section><section><h5  class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
          <p>

            <li>Headings that clarify exactly were the user is inside the content.</li>
            <li>A "how I got here" button. When the user clicks the button they receive orientation information about:

        <p>Use a clear and recognizable design for controls. Make it clear what elements are controls and how to use them.</p>

		    <p>This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Using a common style on controls (for example, links being underlined).
          </li>
          <li>
            Using common design patterns on links and controls (for example, clicking on a link takes you to the page).
          </li>
          <li>
            Making the borders of controls clear. Links in text do not need borders if identified properly (for example, a help icon has a border).

          When this is not possible, provide instructions that explain how to use the control. Instructions should be on the same page or one click away and written in easy to understand language.
        </p>

          </section><section><h5  class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            Controls are parts of web pages that do something, e.g. a link, button, checkbox. Common style and design patterns on controls are easier to recognize and understand how to use it.
		      </p>
        		<p>
        			The goal of these controls is to allow someone to use them. As soon as the user needs to discover the control or work out how to use it, some users will fail.
        		</p>

        		<p>	For example, an older user with age-related forgetfulness takes longer to learn new designs. They go to an ecommerce site that has boxes around the headers (such as "sale"). It also has simple large text for controls such as the "add to cart" button. The user clicks on the headings and not on the "add to cart" button (that looks like text). After a few failures they assume they cannot manage it and leave the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some users have trouble when controls have a different look, color or shape than they have used before. For example, when links do not have underlines and blue or purple text some users will not know there is a link (even if this appears with focus).
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have difficulty with memory, it can be harder to use unique controls. It may take longer to find controls on the page. Even if they work just a little differently than similar ones, some users may need to relearn how to use them each time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using typical controls on the page will help people know how to use them. When using more unique controls, include easy to follow instructions and make them easy to find. It should be easy to identify, understand and use the controls, regardless of how a user uses the page (vision, auditory, voice input).

        <h3>Make the Relationship Clear Between Controls and the Content They Affect (Pattern)</h3>
          <section><h5 class="coga-5">User Need</h5>
        <blockquote><p>I need to know how to use all the controls and the effects of each action.</p></blockquote>
        <p>Related User Story: <a href="#clear-operation-user-story" aria-label="Clear Operation User Story">Clear Operation</a>.</p>
        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
        <p>
          The relationship between controls and affected content should be completely clear and unambiguous.
        </p>
        <p>This can be achieved through:</p>
			<ul>
      <li>Visually grouping controls with the content they relate to,</li>
			<li>including controls within the region they affect,</li>
			<li>using clear dividers or white space between regions in a page that may have separate controls or a scroll bar, </li>
      <li>avoiding multiple or nested scrolling areas.</li>
      </ul>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            If a control on a page operates only on part of the page, it can be hard to tell what it will affect and what it will not. Users may try the wrong control. Many users will try again, and discover the correct control or scrollbar. However, many people with cognitive or learning disabilities may not be able to work out what to do. Others will feel cognitive overload, and stop as a result. They may assume the application is broken, or that it is too complicated for them. For these users, the application will not be usable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clear borders and groupings on the page can help indicate what element the control effects. Having a border or other visual cue around the controls and the relevant section can help make it more understandable. Check with user testing that users with cognitive and learning disabilities find all the page relationships clear and quickly know how to use the controls. Testing is essential when the controls cannot be in the area they affect.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, consider a user living with dementia trying to work out which scrollbar to use for embedded scrollable regions. When they try the wrong scrollbar, they do not get the effect they desire and their content may seem to disappear.
          </p>

	          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Separate Interactive Elements</strong>. For example: Do not have two scroll bars close together. Some users may find it difficult to determine which one to use with a particular section of content. Instead: <ul>
                <li>
                  use clear visual layout and placement of the scroll bars,
                </li>
                <li>
                  break the content into two separate pages, or
                </li>
                <li>
                  consider removing unnecessary information from the page.

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Associate elements and their controls. Place interactive elements like scroll bars and buttons close to the content they can impact. Keep interactive elements further from content to which they do not apply. (This makes it easier to identify which elements will impact each section of content.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Use dividers. Examples of clear dividers include high contrast borders or white space. A change in background color can be a clear divider if the contrast is strong enough.
      			<li>
      			Help the user see the right control. Use large clear buttons and scroll bars.

            <li>
               Controls clearly associated with the section they control by placing the control inside the section, placing clear borders around the section, and labeling the controls to match the section heading. For example:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  On a library site, a search box for the whole site is located in the upper right of the site's main navigation. A second search box searches the library catalog. It is located within a section with a clear border, different background color, and a heading "Library Catalog". The go button reads "search catalog".
                </li>
                <li>A page needs a scrollbar for one section. The scrollbar look like it is inside the section.</li>
              </ul>

          <ol>

          <p>
            People who have language comprehension, learning or reading difficulties may rely on symbols to understand content and navigate to content they need. Symbols also help people who struggle with language and attention to navigate content, including media.
		      </p>
          <p>
            For example, a person with aphasia, has the intellectual ability to understand concepts, but struggles with language. They may be dependent on the use of symbols to browse pages for information.

          <p>
           It can also help the elderly population who can find cluttered pages with dense text hard to read on a screen. Clear symbols, icons and images that act as signposts to the text content can be very helpful.

              <li>how to reach sub-menu items.</li>
            </ul>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
              <p>Users often become confused and lost when they do not understand the visual hierarchy of the site, menus and structure. Clear sub-menus and a well-defined structure will help the user know what is on the site and how to find it.</p>
              <p>Users often are confused when:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>organization is unclear,</li>
              <li>menu terms are hard to understand, and</li>
              <li>Menus and submenus are hard to find.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Dividing the site into clear logical sections can help. Make sections clear and subsections easy to find. Make the category structure and headings easy to understand. Create an outline that could serve as a summary of what is on the site.</p>
              <p>The <strong>terms</strong> used in the menu need to make sense to the user. It needs to be obvious to the user what category the page they are looking for would fall under. Using common words that are familiar to the user is very important.</p>
              <p>Make the levels in the content hierarchy easy to perceive and understand. Minimal type size or type weight differences or color differences may not be perceived or understood. Hierarchy solely dependent on small unique design elements creates confusion.</p>
              <p>For example, a drop down accordion menu of additional sub-menu items may not be viewable without understanding it needs to be clicked (or 'rolled over') as indicated by a small unique design element.</p>
              <p>When opening a web page for the first time, the sub-menus are typically collapsed. Some designs may make it difficult to know that there are submenus. Some users with cognitive disabilities may not guess that sub menus are present. Even if they see a menu expand by accident, they may not generalize that this structure may be present for other items in a menu. Making it easy to notice that there are sub-menu items by adding a visual indicator to ensure users can use all of the site.</p>
              <p>There are times when opening the sub-menu item may not be easy for some with cognitive and learning disabilities. For example, the control to expand a menu item relies on a particular gesture or way of rolling over the area with a mouse. The end user may not figure out how to expand the sub-menu and may abandon the task. For example, a menu that expands only after moving the mouse over a particular side of the menu text.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
            <p>Small design elements that indicate sub-menu items are not always meaningful to the user. Test designs with a diverse user set whenever possible to make sure they are clear.</p>
            <p>Consistent and general best practices should be used to make it understandable to the user.</p>
            <p>Series of nested elements that depend on interpreting small design elements are also confusing, and users may not understand the hierarchy.</p>
            <p>Clearly indicate when text is hidden or when it can be hidden or revealed.</p>

        <h3>Use a Clear and Understandable Page Structure (Pattern)</h3>
        <section><h5 class="coga-5">User Need</h5>
        <blockquote><p>I need to easily understand, navigate and browse both the site and page structure.</p></blockquote>
        <p>Related User Story: <a href="#clear-navigation-user-story" aria-label="Clear Navigation User Story">Clear Navigation</a>.</p>
        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
        <p>Carefully design the layout of the page. Make sure it has a clear structure and hierarchy so that it is easy to understand.</p>
        <p>This can be achieved by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>organizing the page content into logical sections,</li>
          <li>clearly differentiating regions using dividing lines, whitespace and background colors,</li>
          <li>providing headings and other visual cues to indicate the structure and purpose of the regions,</li>
          <li>making any relationship between regions of the page clear, and</li>
          <li>using visual indicators to help people understand:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>structure and relative importance of the page content,</li>
          <li>the grouping and association of items, and</li>
          <li>when items have a different purpose to surrounding information.</li>
        </ul>
        </ul>


          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>

          <p>People with cognitive and learning disabilities may not be able to use content and applications when the page structure and relationships are unclear. The user may not complete tasks and miss key information. The user may not return to pages that are complicated to use and understand.</p>

          <p>Clear, well organized page layouts enable users to easily find key information. They can focus on their tasks instead of working out what is on the page. Using a standard visual layout, and positioning elements consistently will help users rely on muscle memory and use them. This supports people with disabilities that impact their problem solving skills, slow readers, or people who get overwhelmed when presented with a lot of text. This includes:</p>
          <p><strong>A Good Structure:</strong> Organization of page content into sections, each with an obvious purpose, allows users to more easily locate and focus on the sections they need. Content that is not directly relevant to the main purpose of a page should be distinctly separated.</p>
          <p><strong>Use borders and shading to group:</strong> Grouping information using a border or color shading makes it easier for people to identify groups.</p>

          <p>For example: </p>
          <img alt="3 rows of 8 evenly spaced circles divided into two blue rectangles.  The blue backgrounds make the two groupings visually apparent." src="img/common-region-1.png"/>
          <img alt="4 circles divided into two sets of two by a contrasting border. Each set has a blue and a white circle. The white circles are adjacent but border clearly indicates the sets." src="img/common-region-2.png"/>
          <p>Figures: Example of grouping with shading and borders.</p>
          <p><strong>Visual Cues:</strong> People who have difficulty recognizing or comprehending written language or concentrating, can find graphical cues easier to process.  Examples of common graphical indicators and visual cues include:</p>
            <ul><li>grouping summaries of content; </li>
            <li>using a card design using colors or white space; </li>
            <li>flagging important information, such as using call out boxes; and </li>
            <li>indicating different types of information, such as placing quotes in speech bubbles.
            </li></ul>

      <section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
            <p>If pages have a lot of content, check that content is grouped and you can see what is related.</p>
            <p>Making regions and a clear page structure can include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clearly label content categories, and use familiar visual cues and icons. This will help recognition and retrieval rather than rely on memory. The background color can be a clear divider if the contrast is strong enough.</li>
              <li>The heading structure should create an outline of the document that could serve as an abstract of the whole document.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Icons should be used consistently. It is also important the graphical indicators do not clutter the interface. Too many icons can add to the cognitive load for users to process. Examples of clear dividers include high contrast borders or white space. A change in background color can be a clear divider if the contrast is strong enough.</p>

              <li>Headings and icons to help define sections of content. This organizes the information on the page so it is easier to understand the layout and find specific information.</li>
              <li>Call outs boxes.</li>

              <li>Lack of visually differentiated sections.</li>
              <li>Sections without headings or icons that define sections. For example: A web page has chunks of content run into each other with a "flat design". Many users with cognitive disabilities will find it challenging or impossible to work out which chunks belong together. Thus, all the benefits of chunking content are lost. </li>
            <li>Groups and page sections that are not logical.</li>

        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
        <p>Make key content visually stand out. Key content should be visible to users without needing to scroll the page or hover over content. This includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>critical tasks and the controls needed to complete them,</li>
            <li>interactions for critical features (e.g. login forms, send buttons), and</li>
            <li>important information (e.g. health warnings or information that can affect safety).</li>
          </ul>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>Slow readers, people with impaired executive function, impaired memory, and other cognitive and learning disabilities may not be able to find the information and features on a page. For example content that requires a lot of reading or the use of the scroll bar or pointer hovers may be hard to find.  Other users can not find content that requires paging through different screens </p>
          <p>Users who are unfamiliar with the page (or common design patterns) may rely on prominent visual styling aids to find important information. A clear heading structure can also help with this by reducing what needs to be read.</p>
          <p>For example, an elementary school publishes a weekly newsletter with stories, activities and important announcements. One important announcement is that school will end early one day. If The newsletter has less important information before the early school dismissal, and does not have a warning symbol next to the important information. A parent who reads slowly may need to stop before the important information and does not find out that the school is ending early one day. The parent is not home for the child on time.</p>
          <p>In another example, a user is writing a comment, but the send button is not visible when the focus is on the text area. As a result, she cannot see how to send her feedback. The company will then not receive any feedback from groups who unable to find the feedback button.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <p>The amount of page visible before scrolling is dependent on a wide range of factors such as physical device size and resolution. Where possible, use site statistics to understand what technology users are using. Keep this in mind when designing the page.</p>
          <p>Consider the most constrained user experience first (e.g., a 240px wide mobile phone) and then design upwards from there. This will account for the widest range of scenarios. Adopting responsive development practices can improve the flexibility of the page for more devices and situations.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">Getting Started</h5>
          <p>
            Make it easy to find the most important things on the page. Identify
            key content and its placement early in the design process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Space at the top of the document is most likely to be visible to
            users without scrolling. Place key content at the top of the page to give the best experience to the widest range of users.

        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
        <p>Divide long pieces of media into segments that are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>logical</li>
            <li>short</li>

            <li>easy to reach or jump to.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Provide a logical organization and structure that is easy to navigate.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>Using a clear, logical structure, with headings allows users to orient and navigate through the content easily even if they get distracted or lose focus. This is particularly important for people with an attention impairment.</p>
          <p>Providing short logical segments help users find and focus on a specific topic. If the user loses concentration they can find their place in the material and start again from the last point that they remember. This is especially important for educational content or instructions.</p>
          <p>Chunking media also allows for each segment to be given a unique URI. It can then be easily referenced and shared.</p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Some videos can be naturally organized into chapters or segments</li>
            <li>A podcast can be split into segments rather than a single one-hour recording</li>
          </ul>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Six minutes or less:</strong> Media should typically be divided into segments that are 6 minutes or less in duration.</li>
            <li><strong>Navigable:</strong> Provide navigation to each media segment, and a unique, descriptive label.</li>
            <li><strong>Logical order:</strong> Present the links to media segments in a logical order.</li>
            <li><strong>Exception:</strong> Media that has no logical breaking points, do not need to be subdivided.</li>
             </ul>
             Note that is a transcript is available it should be easy to find and navigate.

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
            <p>Having a search capability allows users to find the content they need even if they cannot use the site menus. A user can learn how to use search and reuse that skill on many sites.</p>
            <p>Menu systems and most site navigation require the user to understand the menu categories. Users with impaired executive function may be unable to identify the correct categories.</p>
            <p>In some cases, users know the correct category via memory, rather than logic. For example, most users remember that the print function is often found under the file menu. Users with impaired memory may not be able to find these menu items based on recall.</p>
            <p>Users with impaired short-term memory, age related forgetfulness or who are easily distracted may also find navigating a site and going to many pages to look for content difficult. If it takes too long they may lose focus and forget what they are looking for.</p>
            <p>Search is most useful when it corrects misspellings, finds appropriate or related content and provides suggested auto-corrected versions of the search terms.</p>
            <p>If there are many results from related topics, it helps if search results are presented under the appropriate heading and categories. This helps the user find the search results they are looking for.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>

            Search is less important on small sites where every page is no more than

        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
            <p>Use the tense and the voice that is easiest to understand. In English, this is usually the present tense and active voice. Speak directly to the user, and use the simplest form of verbs and sentence structure.</p>
            <p>Use local plain language guidance to find the tense and the voice that is easiest to understand in different languages.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>Using simple tense and voice benefits many people such as people with language impairments, dyslexia or a memory impairment. For example, more people will understand "press the on button" (present tense and active voice) than "the on button should be pressed." (passive voice)
          <p>Active voice makes it clear who is supposed to take action. For example, "It must be done." is passive voice ad does not say who must act. "You must do it." is active voice and clearly states who has the action.</p>
          <p>Putting the aim of the sentence at the beginning can also make English sentences easier to follow. Local language experts may have additional linguistic advice that helps make content easy to understand.</p>

        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
        <p>
          Use literal and concrete language. When possible, use concrete terms
          and examples that refer to objects or events that you can see, hear or
          touch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not use metaphors and similes unless you include an explanation.
        </p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            Many people do not understand non-literal content. For example, an autistic person may not understand jokes and similes. Sometimes instructions have jokes and similes to make the content friendlier. However, this confuses the user who now cannot do her job as needed.
          </p>
          <p>You can explain any non-literal language by:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Adding a simple language term in brackets next to any non-literal text such as metaphors and similes.</li>
              <li>Providing a pop up definition, or</li>
              <li>Using supported markup (see best practices).</li>
            </ul>
          <p>In non-text media, explain non-literal content as part of the media or include it in a separate file or track. See best practices.</p>

            that may affect the user's rights or wellbeing. This will increase
            the usability in critical places without changing your writing
            style.

        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
        <p>
          Use punctuation and format for text, numbers and symbols that reduce ambiguity and improve
          readability and comprehension.
        </p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
            <p>For some readers, decoding words, numbers and symbols does not happen automatically and can be demanding on working memory and executive functions. If they find content too demanding they are at risk of losing its meaning.</p>
            <p>Some users may use assistive technology or personalization tools to help understand content such as text-to-speech that reads aloud the content. However, sometimes the punctuation or format makes it more likely that the screen reader will read it incorrectly. For example, Roman numerals may be read as text.</p>
            <p>A user with a learning disability may be unable to manipulate letters, numbers, and words to correct mistakes that occur because of formatting or punctuation errors. They also need to focus on understanding the meaning of the content in order to use it.</p>
            <p>For example, a user with a communication disability may listen to content using text-to-speech. If the content is phrased correctly, they can understand it. Sometimes they hear content read incorrectly or skipped, particularly numbers and symbols, and they cannot understand it. If text, numbers or symbols are in an unfamiliar layout, the user may become confused.</p>
            <p>In contrast, a blind person listening to the content, is likely to be able to figure out the correct meaning even when words are not pronounced correctly. However, the word manipulations necessary to work out the correct meaning are not achievable by someone with a communications or language impairment.</p>


          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <p><strong>Use language tags. </strong>Language tags are the key means to achieve the goal of unambiguous text formatting. See HTML [[HTML]] language tags and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">BCP 47 Language Codes</a>.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Use punctuation correctly</strong> for the language you are
            writing in, as it will affect how the stress and intonation (known
            as prosody) patterns from the text are heard, when converted into
            speech. For example, in English, commas and semicolons will result
            in a short pause in the speech, whereas a hyphen - will generally be
            ignored. Question marks, exclamation marks and speech marks can
            result in changes in intonation, such as a rise in the pitch of the
            voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avoid the use of Roman Numerals and unfamiliar symbols</strong
            >
            in text were possible. These can confuse readers and are likely to
            be read incorrectly by text-to-speech tools. If these symbols are
            necessary then ensure they are marked up correctly, using techniques
            such as MathML and abbreviation expansions to provide additional
            support. Roman Numerals should be presented in upper case if used in
            isolation as they are likely to be read as individual letters
          </p>
          <p>
            Long numbers may be read as single digits or phrased as a single number. This is a particular problem for phone numbers or zip codes. While it is difficult to control exactly how these numbers are read aloud, content creators can help by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Displaying the content of the number and using HTML semantics to
              ensure users and assistive technologies are aware of the number's
              purpose. In addition, the following recommendations can assist with
              improving text-to-speech rendering:
            </li>
            <li>
              For phone numbers, use the correct layout for the locality of the phone number and ensure users can select the whole phone number (including area code), so that text-to-speech voices can recognize the format and phrase it correctly.
            </li>
            <li>
              For Zip / Postal codes, include state or address information close to the number so that speech voices can expand known abbreviations (such as state names) and listeners can perceive the context.
            </li>
            <li>
              When writing long numbers, consider what separators will be familiar to your readers and how it will be read aloud. In general, English speaking countries will use commas between thousands and a period as the decimal separator whereas German and other European countries do the opposite. For example, 1,245 would represent one thousand two hundred and forty-five in English, but one point two four five in German. Text-to-speech output will assume the separators are being used in the format of the language of its voice. If this does not match the content, then listeners can become easily confused. While replacing thousand separators with a space has become a common convention to avoid confusion, it leads to difficulties with text-to-speech with long numbers being read out in a disjointed fashion. For example, 120 034 943 can be read as one hundred and twenty, zero three four, nine hundred and forty-three.

            <p>Consider how you write dates, because once again the text-to-speech will use the format associated with the language of the voice. A date such as 04/03/2019 will be read as "April 3rd 2019" by a US English voice and "4th of March 2019" by a British English voice. Writing out the month in words can avoid confusion.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
 		<p>Some languages, such as Hebrew and Arabic, have optional vowels and diacritic marks. Without these marks, most words with the same characters have between two (Hebrew) and seven (Arabic) different ways of being pronounced with different meanings. Most readers can read the word based on the context, and use their visual memory to guess the correct pronunciation. People with impaired visual memory, slow readers and text-to-speech may often guess the incorrect term or pronunciation.</p>

		<p>For example, a user with a language disability is trying to sound out a word. They guess three different pronunciations until they find one that makes sense. Unfortunately, many people with language impairments cannot work out the meaning as words out of context may only provide an idea rather than a specific meaning. Text-to-speech often requires these characters to speak the correct word.</p>

		<p>Note that not all diacritic marks are necessary to pronounce the word correctly. Only letters and diacritic marks that are necessary for the unambiguous pronunciation need to be included.</p>

        <p>
          Emphasize any important keywords to help people understand the purpose and content of the document, and determine if it might contain information they need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Summaries should use common words, short sentences and be written in an easy to understand style and tense.
        </p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            Providing an easy-to-understand summary helps many people to quickly decide if the content is relevant to them and their current goal. A high level outline in a few sentences or bullet points is most effective. Abstracts and executive summaries are usually much longer and more detailed as they are designed to summarize the entire document.
          </p>
		  <p>For media, summaries help users with short attention
			span find the exact file they need and jump to correct content.  All media files should have a summary description.

          </ul>
          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            Step-by-step instructions benefit many people such as people with language impairments, processing difficulties or a memory impairment.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a person with an impaired working memory cannot hold onto many pieces of information at the same time. They are more likely to make mistakes if they need to remember what they are doing, divide the steps, and track what they have done. When instructions are clearly separated and laid out, they can follow them without making mistakes.

        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
        <p>
          Put white space around objects and text, including boxes, paragraph
          headings, and content, so that each section is clearly separated.
        </p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            White space (also called negative space or the background color)
            reduces clutter and provides definition to content. This gives the
            viewer a clear overview of a web page. It is used by designers to
            enhance text and the position of objects on a page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using white space aids navigation through a page and helps people read it. It can help the user find important elements on a page. For those with learning and cognitive impairments, white space has been shown to ease reading difficulties and improve understanding of content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make sure users can also adjust the amount of white space around
            objects and text via a web extension or user setting. This supports
            the ability to identify important elements in the content of a web
            page.
          </p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <p>
            Use clear spacing between letters, words, sentences lines,
            paragraphs and blocks of text.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allow for the ability to easily adjust white space around objects and text, including boxes, paragraph headings, and content, to a degree that suits the user and does not disrupt the overall integrity of a web page. Do not add so much white space that important content can not be seen above the scroll.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that "white space" is a term that means the background color.
            It does not always need to be always white!

        <p>Do not overlay words on busy backgrounds. Provide an option to remove background
		  noise behind auditory content or ensure background sounds do not interfere with
		  the main auditory content.
        </p>
		<p>For text:</p>
			<ul><li>Use solid backgrounds for blocks of text.</li>
				<li>Use thick outlines with solid fills for text that is overlaid on background that has designs running through it.</li>
        <li>Use strong color contrast.</li>

          <p>
            Reading a sentence phrase by phrase conveys more meaning than reading individual words.
			Phrases are also easier to comprehend. The more words an individual can process in one glance,
			the faster they can read, the easier they can understand what's written, and the more they stay interested. Most people can take in a whole
			line of text, or more at once. Fixating on many words at a time is necessary for comprehension for many people. A slow reader may read a sentence slowly using 6 to 9
			eye fixations, sometimes taking in only a single word (or part of a word) at a time. Adding
			backgrounds reduces the number of words readers can fixate on. Removing backgrounds helps users
			comprehend more words at the same time.
          </p>

		  <p>Also, automatic word recognition is often used for reading comprehension. For example, approximately 200 words exist in the English language that do not fit traditional letter sound patterns. These words must be memorized and automatically recognized. If a user can't recognize these words, the text is harder to understand. Backgrounds can increase the amount of time it takes users to recognize words.  </p>
      <p>Similarly, background noise in an audio track can make it harder to process and understand the main content.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
             		<p>Implied content can be difficult for some users because the meaning is not clear. For example, abstract content, sarcasm or metaphor. The meaning is not clear and requires the user to have additional knowledge to understand.</p>

            <p>When using body gestures, emotional communication, and facial expressions as the only way to communicate something, it is important to include this in another way to ensure all users understand. One way this can be done is through supplementary text.</p>
            <p>For example, an image is used in a social media post to communicate a person's true feelings. Some individuals may not be able to understand the emotion being demonstrated by the image. They miss the point the author is trying to make without more context.</p>
            <p>Similarly, a research study asked autistic people to watch a movie that had a lot of implied content. They were watching the actors' mouths, but information such as sarcasm is communicated by their facial expressions. When asked what happened in the movie, some missed the implied communication and the point of the dialogue.</p>

          <p>Not all people can understand numbers and numerical concepts.</p>
          <p>
            For example, some people have dyscalculia, a learning disability
            specifically-related to mathematics. People with dyscalculia have
            significant problems with numbers and mathematical concepts, but
            often excel in other intellectual areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user with dyscalculia may have difficulty processing
            temperature data when presented only in a numeric format. However,
            if non-numeric alternatives are provided (cold, warm, hot etc.) then

          <p>
            Numeracy issues can occur due to a range of disabilities, the most
            severe being the inability to read or understand numbers. Other
            people have challenges with any calculations such as relative sizes
            or times.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user may understand the concept of 90cms as a length but find it hard to cope with the fact that 0.9m and 900mm are the same length.
          </p>
          <p>In another example, a train schedule has a list of relative times that the train leaves on the hour. The user cannot calculate when the next train leaves from their location.</p>

        Objective 4: Help Users Avoid Mistakes and Know How To Correct Them
      </h2>
      <p>Users should be able to avoid mistakes and correct them easily</p>
      <p>if mistakes occur. It is difficult for many users to complete forms, especially people with cognitive and learning disabilities. A good design makes errors less likely.</p>
      <p>Users with cognitive and learning disabilities are more likely to make mistakes. This can include entering information incorrectly or accidently touching the wrong control. Help the user notice form errors and make it easy to correct them. Always let users go back and recover if they accidentally touch a control.</p>
      <p>Completing forms and similar tasks is often overwhelming for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. Many users with cognitive and learning disabilities cannot remember numbers, such as zip or post codes or their social security number. Many users even need to check their phone numbers. This makes entering information slow, and they may need to leave their desks or take breaks. Help them by providing a design that reduces mistakes. Give them the time they need without annoying timeouts and data loss.</p>

          Ensure Controls and Content Do Not Move Unexpectedly (Pattern)
        </h3>
          <section><h5 class="coga-5">User Need</h5>
          <blockquote><p>I need to know where things are. Controls and content do not move unexpectedly as I am using them.</p></blockquote>
          <p>Related User Story: <a href="#assistance-and-support-user-story" aria-label="Assistance and Support User Story">Assistance and Support</a>.</p>
          </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
          <p>Make sure controls and content remain in place and do not move, unless the user initiates the movement. </p>
          <p>A user may initiate a movement by triggering an action or by altering a property of the device, such as window size.</p>
          <p>This can usually be achieved by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ensuring controls and content do not move about as the page loads or refreshes,</li>
                <li>displaying a clear 'loading' indicator if content moves or changes during a page load,</li>
                <li>not updating or moving content, such as an item's position in a list, unless the user causes it.</li>
            </ul>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>If a control moves, users with slow hand-eye coordination or impaired cognitive processing speed may hit the wrong control. This causes unwanted actions and errors. The user may experience disorientation, confusion or even incorrect understanding of the content.</p>
          <p>For example, a user moves to press a button on a video. The user accidentally nudges the device. The orientation changes to landscape and the control moves. Because the user has slow eye tracking or hand-eye coordination, they end up pressing a link to a new video.</p>
          <p>Shifting controls and content can also cause cognitive overload and increase mental fatigue. For example, as a user with Traumatic Brain Injury reads content, the content refreshes and an additional article appears above the current content. The article the user is reading moves down. The user becomes disoriented and the application becomes very hard to use or understand.</p>

        <h3>Let Users Go Back (Pattern)</h3>
        <section><h5 class="coga-5">User Need</h5>
        <blockquote><p>I need predictable back or undo features so that I know exactly where I was previously, before I made a mistake.</p></blockquote>
        <p>Related User Story: <a href="#undo-user-story" aria-label="Undo User Story">Undo</a>.</p>
        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
        <p>Always let the user return to a previous point.</p>
        <p>
          The standard back button is the best way to do this as it is familiar
          to the user. Many users will try the back button first.
        </p>
        <p>The user should never lose their work if they press back.</p>
          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            Allowing users to return to a previous point helps prevent mistakes and makes it easy to
            correct mistakes when they happen.
          </p>
          <p>Examples of mistakes include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>touching a control by accident,</li>
            <li>opening a new link by accident, and</li>
            <li>closing a window the user intended to keep open.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If a person easily makes mistakes or makes them often, it is
            important that they can go back and make changes without having
            their work or previous choices deleted.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user is watching a video. They try to increase the
            volume but touch a different link instead. A new video now loads.
            The user can press the back button and return to the video they were
            watching before. They now know they can try and increase the volume
            and if they make a mistake, they can easily go back and try again.
          </p>
          <p>
            In another example, the back button did not work as expected, but
            took them somewhere else (such as the home page). When they try to
            change the volume or add a comment they often lose the video they
            were watching and cannot find the way to get back to it. The user now
            feels they cannot use any of the website's features in case they
            lose their main content again. They do not expand the screen, change
            the volume, or leave comments.
          </p>
          <p>
            In forms, each time the user has to re-enter data presents a new chance for mistakes to occur. Entering and re-entering data can be stressful and tiring for some people with cognitive and learning disabilities. This increases the likelihood of mistakes and may make it impossible to submit correct data and complete the intended task.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those with anxiety, memory challenges, and difficulty following
            directions, the ability to go back and review information they have
            entered is very important. For example, for some people the task of
            following directions and reviewing their answers works best as two
            separate tasks. Being able to enter information with their focus
            being on following the directions, and later going back to review
            their answers, helps them be more effective.
          </p>

          Notify Users of Fees and Charges at the Start of a Task (Pattern)
        </h3>
        <section><h5 class="coga-5">User Need</h5>
        <blockquote><p>I need support to manage the task, such as letting me know what information I will need (credit card, full address etc) before I start. </p></blockquote>
        <p>Related User Story: <a href="#assistance-and-support-user-story" aria-label="Assistance and Support User Story">Assistance and Support</a>.</p>
        <p>
          Tell the user about all charges at the start of a transaction
          including typical values. Any conditions and terms should also be
          available at the start of the transaction in easy language.
        </p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
              <p>Users with cognitive and learning disabilities who have trouble with memory, attention to detail or reading comprehension may not be aware of charges unless they are explicitly noted at the start of a transaction task. Terms and conditions can be under a link, but charges must be clearly displayed and available in easy to understand language.</p>
              <p>Clearly identifying charges at the start of a sale benefits all users. Those with cognitive and learning disabilities will particularly benefit because some groups are less likely to have inferred or guessed the charges would be included. They may not know to look in other places in the user flow, such as on the homepage, or on a designated rates page.</p>
              <p>People with impaired executive function or memory need to have all the consequences presented in an orderly form to be able to make an informed decision. When charges are not clear, the consent of the transaction is unclear.</p>
              <p>It also can take much longer for users with disabilities to go through the process of making a purchase. If a person has spent hours making an online purchase, it is much more difficult and upsetting to find out that they cannot afford it. They will often blame themselves for not understanding the price and may experience a loss of confidence. They may stop trusting themselves with online, day-to-day activities.</p>
              <p>For example, a person who has challenges with executive function may be trying to order a plane ticket, and not realize that there are extra fees not quoted in the original price, such as taxes, international fees, baggage fees, etc. They may spend hours booking a holiday only to find that they cannot afford it. Alternatively, sometimes they end up purchasing something they cannot afford. And even if they have completed this process in the past, they may not be not able to bring their experience into future purchases to anticipate the final price. The result is the user loses confidence in their ability to independently purchase a holiday online, may have incurred a debt they are unable to pay, may not attempt again, or only with the help of a hired professional (e.g. travel agent or assistant).</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
          <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>

            <li>Clearly stated of ranges of possible charges. For items with shipping charges that vary, list the range of shipping charges and the issues that change the rate, along with a link to where more details can be found.

            <li>Final transactions that include conditions of purchase that are not clear to users from the beginning of the task.</li>
            <li>Transactions that contain charges or conditions that the user did not know about until they had invested a lot of effort into the sale.</li>

        <h3>Design Forms to Prevent Mistakes (Pattern)</h3>

        <p>Related User Story: <a href="#assistance-and-support-user-story" aria-label="Assistance and Support User Story">Assistance and Support</a>.</p>
        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
        <p>Choose a form design that reduces the chance that the user will make a mistake. This includes:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Requiring the user to enter as little information as possible.</li>
          <li>Clearly indicating required fields.</li>
          <li>In a text field, accepting as many formats as possible. For example, accepting different formats of phone numbers.</li>
          <li>Dividing long numbers into chunks (supporting autocomplete across fields).</li>
          <li>Using an interface where only valid input can be selected.</li>
          <li>Using autocomplete and personalization of form controls.</li>
          <li>Accepting voice prompts when supported by the operating system.</li>
          <li>Automatically correcting input errors when possible and reliable.</li>
          <li>Providing the user with known suggestions and corrections.</li>
          </ul>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
            <p>After making many errors, people with cognitive and learning disabilities and users with age-related forgetfulness often abandon their tasks and believe they cannot complete them. Error messages may be confusing. Correcting errors is often difficult and frustrating for users and increases cognitive fatigue. Many users need to stop when they get successive errors.</p>
            <p>For example, while registering for an online banking account a form requires the input of the user's birthdate. The required input format is xx/xx/xxxx with a leading zero for single digits. If a single input field with no input correction is presented, a user with a cognitive disability may enter 1/3/1996 triggering an error notification. It may not be clear to the user that the required format is 01/03/1996 (even if the format is shown below the input field or in the error notification).</p>
            <p>A well-designed form makes it easier to fill in the information and prevents the user from making mistakes by automatically correcting or suggesting the correct date format.</p>
            <p>Minimizing user generated errors by automatically correcting them will also minimize error notifications. Error notifications may be tiring and distracting, taking focus away from tasks and task completion.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <ul>
		  <li>Clearly mark required content.</li>
            <li>

              return May 30th.

            <li>
              The system allows the user to select inappropriate dates without warning. The calendar

            For example, a user with a memory impairment may not remember that
            they have already added an item to their shopping cart and may add
            the item a second time. They may confuse the dates when booking a
            trip or make other mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is essential that people with cognitive impairments have the
            opportunity to check their work AND fix their mistakes easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            For people with cognitive and learning disabilities, mistakes being theoretically
            reversible is not enough. Often the process of reversing a
            transaction is too complex for them to manage without help. They may
            not have access to that help meaning they have to live with all the
            mistakes they have made. In
            addition, if the process of correcting mistakes is too difficult,
            users may stop, either losing the transaction or buying unwanted
            items.
          </p>
          <p>
            The effect of this happening multiple times is devastating. As a result,
            many users with disabilities may stop using
            the Internet for many tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allowing the user to change the number of items in the shopping cart
            at any time can significantly reduce mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            A summary of the order, including product quantities and other costs
            before the final submission, gives the user the chance to identify
            any errors and make changes to the order. In this example given, a
            summary of the purchase helps the user see the error in quantity as
            well as a higher than expected order total.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, a user may realize that a mistake has been made after
            the final submission of data. Provide simple language instructions on how to
            cancel transactions and help the user understand the amount of
            time needed to cancel a transaction. This makes them less
            susceptible to scams.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
            Disorder purchasing a travel ticket on a website may struggle with
            details and may have an impaired attention span. The successful completion
            of the order relies on the information provided at multiple steps in
            the process. An error due to lack of accuracy or attention to detail
            such as an incorrect street number or zip code in the billing
            address will result in the order not going though. If a summary is
            not provided before submitting the final order, the
            user may not understand the reason for the declined payment and give
            up on the order. The user may also stop if there is not a clear and achievable
            way to make a correction.

        <h3>Use Clear Visible Labels (Pattern)</h3>

        <blockquote><p>I need clear labels, step-by-step instructions and clear error messages.</p></blockquote>
        <p>Related User Story: <a href="#assistance-and-support-user-story" aria-label="Assistance and Support User Story">Assistance and Support</a>.</p>
        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
      <p>Use clear labels. Labels should:</p>
			<ul><li>Use common words and easy to understand language,</li>
			<li>Be visible and next to the relevant control, and </li>
			<li>Be readable by assistive technologies, including those used by people with cognitive and learning disabilities.</li>
			</ul>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
        			<p>When labels are missing or unclear, users often do not know that the feature is available or what the control is. Although many users can guess what a control is for users with cognitive and learning disabilities with impaired memory or executive function are less likely to be able to remember the design pattern or work out what it is. A clear label that uses familiar terms and is located next to the control, helps people with cognitive and learning disabilities.</p>
              <p>Similarly, if a label is not next to a control it is confusing for some users. When a label cannot be next to a control, there should be clear visual indicators that visibly and unambiguously associate the label with the control. This will need user testing with users who have learning and cognitive and learning disabilities to ensure it is usable.</p>
              <p>For example, a user living with early stage dementia is using an application. Some controls do not have visual labels. A caregiver shows them what the control is for and they can use the application. The next day they try to use it again, but cannot remember what the control is for. This application is not usable for them.</p>
              <p>In another example, the label disappears when the focus is removed. The user cannot remember what the control is and does not know how to make it reappear.</p>
              <p>Labels need to be visible, readable by AT, and be nearby the labeled content</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <p>
            Many people with learning and cognitive and learning disabilities use web extension and simple text-to-speech. These assistive technologies often do not read WAI-ARIA [[wai-aria-1.2]] or titles. Until that changes, or an extension displays them, labels should not rely on these attributes for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.

            Clear instructions help prevent user errors. This reduces frustration and enhances users' autonomy and independence because they can avoid asking for help. This helps many people with cognitive and learning disabilities as well as people from different cultures, emerging markets and new users who may not be familiar with web forms or may miss cultural context.
          </p>
		  <p>For example, a person with age-related forgetfulness is trying to complete a form. They put the whole address and zip or postal code in one line (as one would do when writing a letter). They are given an error message. After a few error messages, they are exhausted and cannot complete the form.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <p>
            Provide instructions at the start of the process, not simply in an

		  <p>Provide instructions needed to enable the user to complete the task. When multiple formats are accepted or errors are automatically corrected, less instructions are needed for the user to complete the task.</p>

          <p>
            Timed events can present significant barriers for users with cognitive and learning disabilities. These users may require more time to read content or to perform functions, such as completing an online form. They may need to read help or look at notes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users with cognitive and learning disabilities may need additional time to look up the information required to complete a transaction. They may need a break, without losing their place in the process, and without losing data that has already been entered.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, while making a purchase on an e-commerce Web site, a user does not remember required information. This may be a date, a phone number or a zip code that may seem easy to remember for users without a cognitive impairment. They need to look up this information, which takes them time away from the screen. Then they need to copy it carefully into the form.
          </p>

          <p>
            In another example, a user is completing an online process for reserving a hotel room and purchasing a plane ticket. They become overwhelmed with the amount of instruction and data input required to complete the process. The user can not complete the process in one sitting, and take a break.
          </p>

          <p>
            Users' cognitive skills may diminish as they get tired. They then must stop the task for that day. When users know that their data won't be lost, they can recover from mental fatigue and return to successfully complete the task.
          </p>
		      <p>It is important to note that many people need time to read the "timeout" notice. Often, the session ends before the user has finished reading about how to extend the time. If the user is looking up information they will not see the timeout notice. </p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <p>
            When a website must timeout because sensitive information (such as credit card information) is entered or displayed, the website should ask for the sensitive information at the last stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website should also warn the user that once they give the credit card information they should complete the process quickly as the session can timeout.

                <ol>
                <li><strong>Timeout warnings at the start of the task.</strong> For example: In an auction, there is a time limit on the amount of time a user has to submit a bid.

                 <li> <strong>When possible and safe, the user's work is not lost.</strong> For example:
                  A website with sensitive information uses a client-side time limit to help protect users who may step away from their computers. When the user logs in again all the work is still in place back. The user is warned ahead of time how long they have for inactive sessions and is told that their data will not be lost.</li>

          For each step in a process let the user know of its status and if it

        </p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          Making the result of each user action clear helps people with a
          variety of cognitive and learning disabilities:
          <ul>
            <li>
              understand that their actions were processed (e.g., the click did
              something),
            </li>
            <li>prevent uncertainty or doubt regarding the outcome, and</li>
            <li>remember what they just did.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, a user with age-related forgetfulness, may have difficulty remembering how the interface worked. So when they press the send button they may not feel confident that the form was submitted. Feedback, such as a thank you message, will tell them submission occurred and make them feel confident in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            During a multi-step task this feedback (user-action feedback) can also assist people with attention or short-term cognitive and learning disabilities to remember what they are doing. For example, a user with early dementia may get distracted and then forget exactly where they were in the task. This user-action feedback helps re-orient them. It also helps them avoid leaving a task by reminding them that they are in a process, and where in the process they currently are.
          </p>
          <p>
            Provide easily-recognizable success or failure feedback with every
            user action. When possible, the feedback should use consistent and
            familiar design patterns. For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After a step in a multi-step task is completed, breadcrumbs
              display a tick or a checkmark next to that step's name; and, if
              applicable, the title or the name of the next step is readily
              apparent.
            </li>
            <li>
              After a button is clicked, it should look depressed. (Note that if
              it is a toggle button, the state should also be programmatically
              determinable).
            </li>
            <li>
              After a form is submitted or an email message is sent, feedback
              communicating what just happened, such as "Your application was
              submitted, thank you" or "Your email message was sent" is
              provided.
            </li>
          </ul>

            The success or failure of every user initiated action is clearly
            indicated to the user by visual, programmatically-determinable,
            rapid feedback in the primary modalities of the content. Audio

            <p>Users need to know they are safe and secure when using a website, especially when providing information or communicating with others.</p>

            <p>Users with impaired executive functioning are less likely to identify risks correctly so clearly identifying potential risks helps the user stay <strong>safe and in control</strong>. Add helpful tips for staying safe while using your content and provide help in case of problems.</p>
            <p>To help identify risks, we suggest holding research and focus groups with people with cognitive and learning disabilities and to work with people with disabilities to solve potential and existing problems. Groups should have people with learning and cognitive disabilities in mind when working on security and risk mitigation.</p>
            <p>For example, many people who cannot copy and paste passwords or use two-step authorization codes ask a caregiver to help them. As caregivers are often just temporary employees, this leaves the user exposed. Making passwords longer or requiring users change them regularly increases these unsafe practices and can actually make the application less secure. This type of design error is common when people with cognitive and learning disabilities are left out of the user research and analysis.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
 		         <p>Most people are familiar with a single set of units that are commonly used for metrics in their location or culture. When the metrics are in other units they need to perform a conversion in order to understand them. Even tools such as a calculator can be hard to manage. Provide an option to change units and default the units to the users' location. Common examples are the units used for distance, weight, area, currency and temperature.</p>
		<p>For example, a user may know the temperature in Centigrade. When it is given in Fahrenheit, they think it is going to become very warm.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <p>Sometimes metrics are commonly declared in a specific unit even when localized alternatives are available.

        <p>Avoid interruptions. This includes:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Providing an easy way to control interruptions, reminders, and changes in content unless they are started by the user or involve an emergency.</li>

              </ul>
              <p>This content includes: Social media, violent content, advertisements, distracting backgrounds and images, moving content, soft and loud noises, or triggers.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            Interruptions stop people with memory or attention impairments from completing their task. This can include individuals with Dementia, those that have had a stroke or brain injury, and those taking medications with side effects impacting memory or attention. Certain types of interruptions or a certain number may cause them to stop, even if the task is very important. Interruptions can include sounds, content that visually appears or changes (such as advertisements on a page). Interruptions can be as simple as text notifications about the presence of new changes while working in a shared online document.
          </p>
            <p>A site will work best for those with memory or attention challenges
            if they have:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A quiet and simple environment</li>
            <li>no interruptions at all</li>
            <li>an easy to use pause option so interruptions and moving content can be viewed later, or</li>
            <li>a setting where users can select which types of interruptions they can manage and when.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>
            Many news websites have a lot of interruptions that can cause
            challenges for people needing to read important information, such as
            school closures due to bad weather. They may encounter breaking news
            text, advertisements, and pop-up windows. For those with difficulty
            focusing and sifting through the school names, or have two or three
            they need to check, these distractions may make the task impossible.
            By letting the user pause these distractions, and ideally
            temporarily remove them from the page, they will better be able to
            complete the task.
          </p>
          <p>Some people are sensitive to noise and can easily become overwhelmed by too many stimuli. </p>
		  <p>
			  Sometimes, noises and different types of content may adversely affect mental health. For example, noises, distractions or distressing content may make the user more anxious or possibly trigger post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There has also been research to suggest that too many interruptions and use of social media may aggravate depression and difficulty focusing. Allowing users to control this content could help them be more productive online.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where standard techniques exist to remove or control distractions, they should be used.
          </p>
		  <p>For example, a person with traumatic brain injury is filling out their taxes online.
		  The social media application pings them with notifications. They try to turn notifications
		  off and then they try to turn off the application, but it is too complex. They are unable
		  to submit their taxes without help. </p>

        <p>
          Keep the interface simple. Provide users with five or less main choices on each screen and remove unnecessary content. This can be provided via a simplified version, as an alternative that is generated in real time from the same code base as the main content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Extra links that do not relate to the main purpose of the page should be limited to the footer section. Extra choices can also be hidden under a "more" link or other clear and descriptive titles.

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            Busy pages, too much text, too many images and too much other content can cause cognitive overload, anxiety and loss of focus. Keeping content down to a small number of important points reduces the clutter, calms the user and allows for better understanding while aiding memory. For example, it can help  slow readers or  those with a short attention span, who may leave the page if it appears complex
          </p>
		      <p>Simplified content and a consistent simple design helps reduce cognitive overload and decreases stress and mental fatigue. For example, a person with early stage dementia goes to their doctor's application. There are five choices on the screen: appointments, ask your doctor a question, test results, approvals and more. Each option has an icon, clear text and is separated by whitespace. In two clicks they have asked their doctor their question. They can easily select what they need without asking for help. More options are also available if they swipe left. However, they are unlikely to do so.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <p>
            Avoiding long paragraphs, lots of choices, and non-meaningful imagery ensures those with cognitive impairments can concentrate on the important points being made.

            Keeping to a few short bullet points and limiting to one or two
            images related to the main subject areas of a website or service
            allows the user to choose whether to explore the site further.

          <p>
            The intent of this pattern is not to clutter the page with
            unnecessary information but to provide important cues and
            instructions that will benefit people with disabilities. Too much
            information or instruction can be just as much of a hindrance as too
            little. The goal is to make certain that enough information is
            provided for the user to accomplish the task without undue confusion
            or navigation.

				<li>Overview of the process and next step.</li></ul>
		<p>Once the user starts the task, ensure the user clearly understands when the task is still "in-process" and when it has been completed.</p>

          <p>
            Some users find distractions difficult especially when the distractions cause them to switch focus mid-task and subsequently return where they left off. For example, a website may have a large arrow pointing the way to the "book here" link. The arrow emphasizes the start of the booking task, and will help users know when they have started the task.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often people need to manage their times of concentration so they can focus without interruptions. Prior advice on the time a task takes, it's complexity or working memory load enables them to better prepare and complete it without unintentional abandonment. The list of required resources before starting the task, along and the number steps left until completion of the task, will help users avoid failures.

        <p>Memory barriers stop many users from using products or accessing help or content.</p>
        <p>People with any impairment that affects memory or language can find it difficult or impossible to overcome memory barriers.</p>
        <p>For example, many users have an impaired short-term memory. On average people can remember 7 letters or items at the same time. A person with an impaired working memory may be able to remember one to four pieces of information at the same time (depending on the extent of the impairment).

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            People with memory impairments often forget their passwords and are not able to login. Their solutions often are only sometimes helpful and have security risks:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              They may have to look at or listen to text several times to copy
              or type it into a form field;
            </li>
            <li>
              They may reuse a single password or use a simple-to-remember
              password, which they can remember.
            </li>
            <li>
              If they need to change their password or use a complicated
              password they may store passwords insecurely, such as written on
              pieces of paper which other people can see.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>They may also struggle with other steps during login, such as:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>entering characters in the correct order</li>
            <li>entering characters correctly with a limited number of tries (resulting in being locked out).</li>
            <li>finding a PIN</li>
            <li>working out puzzles or distorted letters</li>
            </ul>
            <p>copy characters correctly from another device.</p>
                      <p>Users can stop after getting frustrated with time-limited procedures or presentations of digital security tokens. Or they can be locked out of vital services because of their disability.</p>
            <p>Without this design requirement, many people cannot use an application or content at all. See <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/privacy-security.html">Security and Privacy Technologies</a> issue paper for the full description of this issue, and how it stops people from using web services that are often critical. Many people cannot make doctors' appointments, etc., by themselves. This may be partly responsible for the reduced life expectancy of people with learning and cognitive disabilities.</p>
          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <p>There are many ways to meet this design pattern:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/">Web Authentication: An
<abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> for accessing Public Key Credentials</a> [[webauthn-2]] to support inclusive alternatives that do not rely on typical cognitive abilities. For example, hardware authentication devices, smartcard or FIDO.</li>
            <li>Provide automatic user authentication based upon the use of a trusted device (to which the user has already logged in with their own identity). The user does not have to transcribe characters, but may have to press a link to identify they have the device.</li>
            <li>Allow a biometrics option.</li>
            <li>Use a system the user is already logged into via third-party authentication services (e.g., OAuth etc.).</li>
            </ul>
			<p>
              Methods of meeting requirements for alternative user
              authentication would include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Clicking a link sent to an email address or a phone number;
                  (Note that this is easy to implement and may be useful for
                  minimal security, such as allowing comments on a blog).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Logging in by using information present in users' personal
                  documentation, such as the total number of a current account
                  balance, with explanation on how to find this information.

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            Many people cannot use voice menu systems.
            This often stops people from completing critical tasks by themselves. Often
            this can include making doctors' appointments, getting health
            insurance, reaching social services, getting their water turned back on,
            etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            If people cannot manage voice menus by themselves, they have to ask someone else to help them. This means the service is not accessible to them.  Sometimes tasks are not done. For example, they may delay making a doctor's appointment or other critical task as not to bother their helper. People often do not get the help they need or get it too late. (This may be partly responsible for the lower life expectancy of people with learning and cognitive disabilities.)
          </p>

          <p>Why can't people use complex menus?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A good short-term and working memory (several seconds) is essential so that the user can remember the number or the term for the menu. Without these functions the user is likely to select the wrong number.</li>
            <li>Many users have an impaired working memory. For example, if you can remember 7 letters or items in your head at the same time they may be able to remember one or two. This makes them less likely to manage a menu system correctly.</li>
            <li>For example, a phone menu system (voice markup system) may have an option: "Press 3 for internal services" To use this option the user must remember a digit 3 while figuring out if they need an internal service. Many people cannot do this. It also requires them to press the correct digit.</li>
            <li>When a lot of irrelevant information is given before the correct option, the user may have cognitive overload and stop. This is especially true if they did not understand all the earlier options and information.</li>
            <li>They may not understand the terms used. Having focused on the menu, they may forget why they are calling.</li>
            <li>Alternative routes, such as web menus, may be provided but are also complex. They are therefore not helpful.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The 0 digit, the word 'help' or other culturally appropriate term, should be reserved for reaching a person. Consistently set the first option for each menu to: "to wait for a person who can help you press 0". This can help everyone reach the support they need.
          </p>

		      <p>Test any system with a wide range of users with different learning and cognitive disabilities. Involving a wide range of users has made many voice systems accessible to the extent that they become an aid people with cognitive and learning disabilities. </p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <p>Follow best practices in general voice user interface (VUI) design. Standard best practices in voice user interface apply to users with cognitive disabilities, and should be followed. These practices are improving as more designs focus on conversational interfaces. Some examples of generally accepted best practices in voice user interface design:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pauses are important between phrases in order to allow processing time of language and options.</li>
            <li>Options in text should be given before the digit to select, or the instruction to select that option. This will mean that the user does not need to remember the digit or instruction whilst processing the term. For example: The prompt "press 1 for the secretary," requires the user to remember the digit 1 while interpreting the term "secretary". A better prompt is "for the secretary (pause): press 1" or " for the secretary (pause) or for more help (pause): press 1"</li>
            <li>Error recovery should be simple, and take the user to a human operator if the error persists. Error responses should not end the call or send the user to a more complex menu.</li>
            <li>Advertisements and other extraneous information should not be read as it can confuse the user and can make it harder to retain attention.</li>
            <li>Terms used should be as simple and jargon-free as possible.</li>
            <li>Use Tapered prompts. Best practices in voice user interface design include providing several different prompts for each point in the interaction. The different prompts are used based on the user's behavior. For example, if the user takes a long time to respond to a prompt, a simpler or more explanatory version of the prompt can be used instead of the default. They should be used to increase the level of prompt detail when the user does not respond as expected.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>User settings</strong></p>
            <p>User-specific settings can be used to customize the voice user interface (such as menus, and options). Keep in mind that if it is difficult to set user preferences, they won't be used. Setting preferences by natural language is the most natural ("slow down!"), but is not currently very common.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Extra time should be a user setting for both the speed of speech and ability for the user to define if they need a slower speech or more input time etc. Timed text should be adjustable (as with all accessible media).</li>
            <li>The user should be able to extend or disable timeouts as a system default on their device.</li>
            <li>Error recovery should be simple, and take you to a human operator. Error responses should not throw the user off the line or send them to a more complex menu. Preferably they should use a reserved digit for support and human help.</li>
            <li>Advertisement and other information should not be read as it can confuse the user and can make it harder to retain attention.</li>
            <li>Terms used should be as simple as possible.</li>
            <li>Examples and advice should be given on how to build a prompt that reduces the cognitive load
            <ul>
            <li>Example 1: Reducing cognitive load: The prompt "press 1 for the secretary," requires the user to remember the digit 1 while interpreting the term secretary. It is less good then the prompt "for the secretary (pause): press 1" or " for the secretary (pause) or for more help (pause): press 1"</li>
            <li>Example 2: Setting a default for a human operator as the number 0</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Considerations for Speech Recognition</strong></p>

            <ul>
            <li>For speech recognition based systems, standards for voice commands for many languages exists and should be used where possible, such as the ETSI standard <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_es/202000_202099/202076/02.01.01_50/es_202076v020101m.pdf">ETSI 202 076</a>. Keep in mind that expecting people to learn more than a few commands places a cognitive burden on the user.</li>
            <li>Natural language understanding systems allow users to state their requests in their own words. This can be useful for users who have difficulty remembering menu options, or who have difficulty mapping the offered menu options to their goals. However, natural language interfaces can be difficult to use for users who have difficulty producing speech or language. Directed dialog (menu-based) fallback or transfer to an agent should be provided. Such fallbacks should be easy to use and conform to this document.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Follow requirements of legislation</p>
            <p>For example, the U.S. Telecommunications Act Section 255 Accessibility Guidelines [Section255] paragraph 1193.41 Input, control, and mechanical functions, clauses (g), (h) and (i) apply to cognitive disabilities and require that equipment should be operable without time-dependent controls, the ability to speak, and should be operable by persons with limited cognitive skills.</p>

        <p>Related User Story: <a href="#remembering-from-previous-steps-user-story" aria-label="Previous Steps User Story.">Previous Steps</a>.</p>
        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
		        <p>Create a process that does not require:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>remembering digits to select for a short time</li>
            <li>performing calculations</li>
            <li>copying</li>
            <li>clear speech or fast responses</li>
            <li>memorizing characters, strings or pin numbers</li>
            <li>using executive function to work out the category of the service they need</li>
            <li>recalling information over multiple steps. When going through multiple steps, each step in a process must contain the information needed to allow a user to proceed. They must not rely on memory from prior steps.</li>
            <li>Instructions and labels should be located before a call to action or activation mechanism.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When appropriate, provide a summary of information from previous steps, and a mechanism for traversing the process.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
            <p>Often content has barriers which prevent users with cognitive and learning disabilities from completing a step or process, and as a result, prevents them from achieving whatever they wished to achieve.</p>
            <p>To increase security when making a purchase, sometimes puzzles or calculations are required. For example: To finalize a purchase, a user is asked to enter the result of multiplying positions 1 and 2 of a number. This type of statement can not be understood by some people with cognitive and learning disabilities. Both security and cognitive accessibility should be guaranteed.</p>
            <p>Many users have an impaired working memory. They can not remember many details at the same time. However, systems, such as dialog menus, rely on all users using working memory to make choices. They expect the user to remember several choices and to select one choice, whether by speaking or through a key press. The user needs to hold multiple pieces of transitory information in the mind.</p>
            <p>Users with an impaired executive function may need more time to complete a task. But there can also be problems if the system response is too slow. For example some people may need longer to compare similar options such as "billing", "accounts", "sales" and decide which is the service they need. Using clear language will also help.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <p>Good practice that reduces the reliance on memory skills include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Each step in a process should contain the information necessary to allow a user to proceed. They must <strong>not </strong>rely on memory from prior steps.</li>
            <li>Providing a simple way to go back without having to start at the beginning.</li>
            <li>Inform users of where they are in the process, for example through a step indicator.</li>
            <li>If users make a mistake or error, provide help to fix it rather than restarting the process</li>
            <li>When useful, provide a summary of information from previous steps, and an easy mechanism for traversing the process is available.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For voice interfaces:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Pause between each option.</li>
            <li>Waiting for a slow speaker to respond.</li>
            <li>Listen for a quiet or hesitant speaker.</li>
            <li>Allow simple, one word responses</li>
            <li>State the option before the number to command to be selected.</li>
            <li>Support forgetfulness and memory impairments.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Note that this is essential for critical systems such as health, finance, communication, water and government services.</p>

        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
        <p>Many people rely on human help. When possible, there is human help available, and it is easy to use. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Easy to find on each page and at each step of a process.</li>
            <li>Easy to use via the mechanism the user prefers.</li>
            <li>Requires as few steps as possible, such as:
            <ul>
            <li>a form with two fields or</li>
            <li>an email address</li>
            <li>a phone number that goes directly to a human.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Access to human help should never require the user to manage complex menu systems such as a voice menu with many different options.</p>

            <p>Organizations mechanisms should be in place to ensure support staff effectively help people with learning and cognitive disabilities and provide a good experience.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
            <p>When a user gets stuck or confused for any reason, getting help from a human is usually the most effective solution. In reality many sites provide this option only to users who can navigate complex systems.</p>
            <p>Examples of complex system include a process where a user needs to follow many links to get to the human contact information. It could also be a phone number requiring the user to answer many questions before connecting with a person. With a complex system, the people who need it most will not have access to the human help option. They may the user may have cognitive overload and stop trying to complete the process. They may also leave with a negative attitude towards the service or supplier.</p>
            <p>For example, a user with an intellectual disability wants to use a coupon. They cannot find the instructions for applying the coupon to their online purchase, and they cannot find the phone number for support. They effectively cannot use the coupon.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>

<p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
            <ol>

            <li>A number that goes directly to a human or an available standard to get human help for example, using the 0 digit on voice menu systems.</li>
            <li>An email link using the 'mailto [[mailto]]' protocol with prefilled 'to' and 'subject' fields. Note that this will not work on all platforms or mail clients.</li>
            <li>An option for live chat or video call help. Note: It must be fully accessible and easy to close new windows that open as part of live help functionality. Ensure live chats do not distract users from their task.</li>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
             <p>The use of complex information, long documents and complex data formats can present significant barriers to users with cognitive accessibility needs. Users should be able to understand the information and successfully complete described tasks without requiring further external assistance as much as possible.</p>
          <p>Sometimes the content's subject matter is complex. In this case, it is likely to need careful explanation, organization and presentation so as many users as possible are able to understand without any mistakes, confusion or need of assistance.</p>
          <p>The way information is presented, such as a graph, diagram or table, may make it more complex for some users. Here, a supporting description and guided interpretation will highlight the key features the user needs to understand.</p>

          <p>Different people find different types of information easier to understand. This is particularly true for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. For example, some people have an impairment that affects numbers but not language, and other people have a language impairment but may intuitively understand numbers. Help may be provided in various forms, to support different users, for example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Text "asides" providing explanation and help for diagrams.</li>
            <li>A supporting chart or graph to illuminate text content.</li>
			<li>Video clips that show the tasks being completed in steps.</li>
            <li>A supplemental table - as long as it is not itself complex.</li>
            <li>
              Popup on hover explanations of keywords - possibly linked to a
              glossary.

        <p>
          When presenting users with actions and selections, clearly explain the benefits, risks and consequences of each option. This includes any:</p>
			<ul><li>changes from what the user asked for</li>
			<li>disadvantages from the standard product or offering</li>
			<li>features that may be a  risk to users wellbeing or finances.</li></ul>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            Clearly stating benefits and consequences of each action and selection option helps individuals avoid mistakes.
			This is particularly important when the results cannot be easily corrected, lead to safety risks, or may never be known.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, a user of a travel site is booking a trip to Geneva. They see an option at a good time, but this ticket is to a different city. They assume the options given are to the location they asked for. They check the dates and times, but, because they can only read by spelling out words, they do not notice the changed destination. They are taken to a different location than their hotel, and the vulnerable user arrives at night in an unfamiliar city without accommodation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In another example, a user sees a laptop for sale at a good price. They do not see the refurbished word in the long description. The laptop is not actually a good price.

              <ul><li>For example: Meal options from an online menu have fun names. The meal contents, side items, allergy information and ability to customize each option is not visible until two steps later in the process. A customer must go several screens down on each item in order to make a decision.</li>

        <h3>Provide Help for Forms and Non-standard Controls (Pattern)</h3>
        <section><h5 class="coga-5">User Need</h5>
        <blockquote><p>I need explanations for unusual controls in a form I find easy to use (such as a video or text).</p></blockquote>
        <p>Related User Story: <a href="#task-management-user-story" aria-label="Task Management User Story">Task Management</a>.</p>
        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
        <p>
          Provide help for any complex forms, particularly when there are
          multiple steps, unusual interactions, non-standard controls and
          required fields that do not support autocomplete. Give examples
		  that make it easy to understand what to do.
        </p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            Users often find forms and related tasks to be the most complex experience with websites. They can easily become confused, unsure, or even completely lost. Providing extra help can make the difference between being able to successfully complete a task and giving up. This is especially true if any part of the form is complex or requires nonstandard interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many standard form controls provide support automatically. For example, many fields can be automatically filled in with information using autocomplete or personalization semantics [[personalization-semantics-content-1.0]]. Then the user will not make mistakes filling it out.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you require additional fields and nonstandard controls many users will have difficulty using them. Many users with disabilities will get the information incorrect or be unable to work out how to complete the task. Often this results in the task being completely abandoned. In other cases, the user asks a caregiver for help to complete the form or work the control. In either case, they have not been able to complete the task because of their disability.
          </p>
          <p>
            The standard [[HTML]] forms and controls have been carefully specified for maximum usability and accessibility. They are usually understood by users, especially if they are familiar with web interactions. However, users are likely to experience difficulties if the standard form behavior has been altered or completely new controls are provided. Assuming the new behaviors have been carefully designed and user tested, users may still require help in order to successfully use them.
          </p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>

          <p>Examples of forms and controls that are likely to require additional help:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Password fields that require certain character types of characters to be entered.</li>
            <li>Surveys with complex interactions, for example where buttons only appear depending on previous answers.</li>
            <li>Date entry where there could be some ambiguity about the required format.</li>
            <li>Custom controls like date pickers where some dates may be grayed out.</li>
            </ul>

        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
        <p>
          Make it easy for the user to ask for help or report issues at any point in a process. This
          includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Easy to Use: Feedback information and forms are simple and clear.
            (User testing with different user groups is highly recommended.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Easy to Find: Available from any place where the user may get stuck
          </li>
		  <li>Using a preferred communication method such as a form, email, chat, or phone support</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The option to provide feedback should never require the user to manage
          complex menu systems such as Integrated Voice Menus (IVR) with many
          different options.
        </p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            Providing an easy way for users to give feedback will help people be able to share problems, ask for help, make suggestions and positive comments. If users cannot give feedback easily, problems will continue to exist without the site owner being aware of the problems. It is essential to allow users to provide feedback from any point in the process so that people do not get lost when trying to explain why they are stuck. Ideas for improvements and positive feedback will also be missed.
          </p>
		  <p>For example, a user with a cognitive and learning disability struggles to use an ecommerce site. They have an idea about how to make it much easier to use. They spend an hour trying to give the feedback and then they stop trying. The site continues to lose customers.</p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <p>Make sure the feedback option is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>simple to use,</li>
            <li>available in all stages of the process,</li>
            <li>
             a process that responds helpfully to any feedback submitted,
            </li>
            <li>easy to complete and does not make the user provide unnecessary information, and</li>
            <li>not reliant on complex menu systems.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Providing multiple methods for gathering feedback is recommended.
            For example, on a website, consider providing all 4 options for
            feedback including live chat, a phone number, a web form and a
            feedback email address.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that chat bots may not be appropriate for this particular type
            of feedback other than to start the feedback process. These can be
            extremely frustrating if you cannot easily get to the area you are
            trying to reach.

        <p>Related User Story: <a href="#help-user-story" aria-label="Help User Story">Help</a>.</p>
        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
        <p>
          Content is provided that helps users understand and use directions or
          navigational systems. This can include:
        </p>
    			<ul>
            <li>Providing landmarks that are easily recognized.</li>
            <li>Providing cardinal directions (ie general or global) that can be related to a static object such as north of the tower.</li>
            <li>Helping people avoid changes that confuse them, such as a change of orientation or routing.</li>
            <li>Facilitating reorientation when leaving the route.</li>
            <li>Supporting different ways people are aware of distances, and</li>
            <li>Allowing personalization of terms such as directions and measurements.</li>
            </ul>



          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
           People with cognitive and learning disabilities experience different levels of difficulty with wayfinding directions or wayfinding applications. The help needed to address wayfinding issues can be different for indoor navigation, where there are more stimuli, and outdoors, where there can be more demands on memory. The help needed also varies with the individual.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wayfinding requires many cognitive functions. Designs should accommodate a wide range of cognitive impairments including those supported by other Design Patterns. For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>memory,</li>
            <li>executive function,</li>
            <li>spatial orientation,</li>
            <li>visual/spatial attention, perception and processing,</li>
            <li>spatial disorientation anxiety,</li>
            <li>language processing,</li>
            <li>intellectual,</li>
            <li>attention</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Some users may need more detailed help, such as step-by-step directions. Many users need to preview a route before following it. Then landmarks can help with recognition and orientation as well as reducing anxiety. Alternative relative directional terms and cardinal directions matching a user's preferences are most effective. For example the application could refer to  "the driver's side" or "the East Wing". Helping people imagine relative and absolute distances can help, for example "you've travelled half way".
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the wide variation in personal requirements, personalization mechanisms can be very useful. For example, the units used for distances.
            Platforms or other technologies often provide personalization options for relative and cardinal directions and terms which can be used. For
            example, the platform locale settings.
          </p>
          <p>Changes can be very confusing. A user may be prepared to change the route to save hours of traffic, but this will involve them pulling into a gas station to  learn the new route. They may not want to change routes to avoid a small amount of traffic. Help the user to find the option that works for them.</p>
		      <p>For example a person with traumatic brain injury is using a Global Positioning System (GPS). They review the route before leaving, and look at pictures of the turns. These preparations will enable them to follow the route. While driving, the route changes to avoid three minutes of traffic. They are no longer able to follow it and become lost.</p>

        <h3>Provide Reminders (Pattern)</h3>
        <section><h5 class="coga-5">User Need</h5>
        <blockquote><p>I need reminders integrated into my calendar, otherwise I will forget appointments and when I am meant to do things. Sometimes I need reminders to revisit a website to complete the next task.</p></blockquote>
        <p>Related User Story: <a href="#support-user-story" aria-label="Support User Story">Support</a>.</p>
        </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
        <p>
          Make it easy for the user to set a reminder for date and time sensitive events. Use standard application programming interfaces (APIs) when possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reminders must be set only at the user's request and the user must be able to personalize the remainder method.
        </p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            People with cognitive and learning difficulties often have challenges managing events and time. (In fact, being unable to correctly manage events and time without support is a diagnostic criterion for some groups of disabilities.)  This results in missing meetings, not submitting a request by a certain date or a form within a specified time period and missed opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using calendar
<abbr title="application programming interface">APIs</abbr> (or task manager) that allow the user to
            automatically add events and deadlines to their own calendar can
            help. For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When the user copies information into a calendar they often copy
              the day or time incorrectly.
            </li>
            <li>
              The user is challenged processing and retaining time based
              information.
            </li>
            <li>The user may find it hard to sequence time-bound events.</li>
            <li>
              The user's skills decrease when tired to such an extent that they
              have to stop a task. They may wish to reschedule the task.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, a user with a cognitive and learning disability sets a doctor's appointment online. Often they copy the details incorrectly into their calendar. However, in this case, the website gives them an option to add the appointment to the calendar and sets a reminder an hour before. The user now comes to the correct place at the correct time with the correct papers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The benefit to users with cognitive accessibility needs is that they
            can independently manage appointments, deadlines and schedules. The
            ability to set reminders can reduce the cognitive load associated
            when processing time bound tasks. Time dependent activities may be
            monitored and tracked by the user to ensure that they are completed
            in a timely manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Always give the option to set a reminder at the end of the task so
            that the user does not get interrupted.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is essential not to add unwanted reminders, as this makes the
            user's calendar too full. This can even prevent them from being able
            to use their calendar at all. The user is the best person to know
            how many reminders, and which type, will best meet their needs.

            Date and time sensitive events are any event that has to be
            completed by a certain time. The time constraints on such an event
            may be defined by a calendar date and time or by the total elapsed
            time.

         <p>
          Ensure that changes of context, functionality, settings, route and
          orientation are initiated only by user request or an easily available
          mechanism is available to turn off such changes. Also provide an easily available
          mechanism to go to previous context, functionality,
          settings, route and orientation.
        </p>

          </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            Any content, settings or functionality which changes unexpectedly, without user initiation can result in significant problems for users with cognitive and learning disabilities. Unexpected changes in any of these areas can result in loss of focus, anxiety, or confusion in understanding or using a user interface (such as menus, buttons and design components). Examples include, but are not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The automatic launching of new windows or pop-ups.</li>
            <li>
              Submission of forms through mechanisms other than a button that is clearly labeled (using simple language to submit the form).
            </li>
            <li>The opening of new content or a feature.</li>
			<li>Unexpected changes when selecting an option.</li>
			<li>Rerouting automatically by a Global Positioning System (GPS); and</li>
            <li>Changing the direction of a map in a GPS.</li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, a user may not have a sense of direction or know their
            left and right. Before using a GPS, they may study the route so that
            they know approximately what they are doing and can augment the
            directions of the GPS with their own context, using the GPS for
            cues. The GPS automatically reroutes them because of a small traffic
            delay. They become completely lost and disoriented and can no
            longer use the application.
          </p>
		  <p>In another example, a user is watching a video and wants to press "like". As they are about to press the button, the controls shift and they load a different video instead of pressing "like". They are now less likely to press "like" because they do not want to lose their content. As a result their preferences are not taken into account </p>
          <p>
            Letting users control when content changes gives users with cognitive and learning disabilities more control over how websites and applications behave. This gives them the opportunity to make choices that enable them to use the content and complete the task.

                  <p>
                    People with cognitive and learning disabilities are often using add-ons or extensions as assistive technology. For example:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Reading of the long form of acronyms;</li>

                      Support for text-to-speech with synchronized highlighting of the

                    <li>Content simplification;</li>
                    <li>Creating mind maps out of the heading structure;</li>
                    <li>
                      Support for retaining content that has already been entered;
                    </li>
                    <li>Password management;</li>
                    <li>Spell checking;</li>
                    <li>Changing the symbols or the interface.</li>
        			<li>Changing numbers from digits to words and words to digits</li>
        			<li>Adding white space between lines, sentences, phrases, and chunks</li>
        			<li>Alternative ways to input the content such as speech recognition</li>
        			<li>Adding pictures</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>However, sometimes a website stops extensions and
<abbr title="application programming interface">APIs</abbr> from working. The result is that these users cannot use this website.</p>
                  <p>
                    If these add-ons and
<abbr title="application programming interface">APIs</abbr> are not supported, the author should provide support for all the functions of the add-ons used as assistive technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, a user with traumatic brain injury has executive
                    function and memory impairments impacting their ability to remember
                    details such as:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>the icons or symbols on a Web of Things (WoT) interface;</li>
                    <li>their username and password;</li>
                    <li>what an acronym stands for;</li>
                    <li>A phone number, or</li>
                    <li>the meaning of uncommon words</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Supporting the use of an add-on that simplifies content and gives support (such as the long form of acronyms, and a popup dictionary) enables them to understand most content.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Supporting password management tools enables users to successfully login and avoid being locked out of secure sites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Storing non-sensitive information and auto complete helps them fill out a form. This suggests common information, like a person's phone number or address. It also helps them avoid making mistakes. It eliminates the need for accurately recalling this information from memory or having to copy and paste it, which is a task that often prevents them from successfully using a form.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When overwhelmed by textual content, they have an extension that
                    inserts symbols that they are familiar with that helps them find the
                    content they need.
                  </p>
                  <p>Too many options may add to the complexity of interacting with IoT devices. Additional options should be easy to ignore and not require a lot of reading to understand that they are additional, as well as how to skip them.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes the&nbsp; Internet of Things (IoT) interfaces may confuse the user, such as a default "reading" on a meter being set to &ldquo;2&rdquo; and not &ldquo;1.&rdquo; The user would then need to reset it to &ldquo;1.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>It is important in any proposed solution to make operational tasks, such as interacting with the IoT, as transparent as possible so that users can focus their attention on the functional aspects, such as relating to content.</p>

              </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
              <p>
                A user who has difficulty reading or using Web content can be easily overwhelmed with too much information on a web page. They need to simplify the page to include the critical information that they need and not spend all their energy reading and understanding other content and features. This is also true for users who are easily distracted.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, an email program has lots of features and formatting
                options when drafting an email. This makes it too complex for a lot
                of people. With personalization the user can have a simple option
                with only send and cancel options. There is a "to" and subject line
                but no cc or bcc options. In this setting there is a clear heading
                (write an email) and they have icons that the user understands.

              <h3>Support a Personalized and Familiar Interface (Pattern)</h3>
              <section><h5 class="coga-5">User Need</h5>
              <blockquote><p>I need (a version of) a familiar interface, that I recognize and know what will happen.</p></blockquote>

              </section><section class="wtd"><h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
              <p>Provide users with a way to personalize their interface to make it familiar.</p>
              <p>This can be done by:</p>
                  <ol>
                  <li>Allowing user preferences on presentation such as font style, font size, line heights, margins and contrast. (Note: The default version should still be readable and use clear fonts.)</li>
                  <li>Allowing a rollback to a previous interface that the user is familiar with and knows how to use.</li>
                  <li>Adding semantics on controls, links and symbols that allow the user to control the experience. For example:
                  <ul>
                  <li>HTML5 autocomplete on common fields</li>
                  <li>adding a toolbar that adds personalized images</li>
                  <li>use attributes in [[personalization-semantics-1.0]].</li>
                  </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
            <p>Ensure the user knows the personalization options and can easily configure them. Clear instructions can help. </p>

            </section><section><h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
            <p>Personalization changes the interface to meet the needs of the user.</p>
            <p>Having familiar terms and symbols is key to many users being able to use the web. However, what is familiar for one user may be unfamiliar to another requiring them to learn new symbols. Adding semantics allows symbols and support to be added by an extension or browser that is familiar to the individual user.</p>
            <p>A stronger example is people using <abbr title="Alternative and Augmentative Communication System"><a href="#dfn-AAC">AAC</a></abbr>. These users usually only learn one symbol set. They cannot easily communicate with other symbol users in a written format or may struggle to understand different symbols used in different applications. When using personalization, such as [[personalization-semantics-1.0]] the user agents can load the symbols that are understandable by the individual user. The user can also access the web and other applications.</p>

            <p>Other support includes autocomplete and extensions that help the user fill out forms and understand the content. Many users with memory or executive function impairments cannot fill in forms without asking someone to help copy over information or check their work. Autocomplete allows many more users to manage forms by themselves.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Use the HTML autocomplete tags on all common fields</li>
              <li>Add a toolbar that adds personalized images, or</li>
              <li>
                Add the semantics that can work with a toolbar for personalized
                images.
              </li>
            </ul>
